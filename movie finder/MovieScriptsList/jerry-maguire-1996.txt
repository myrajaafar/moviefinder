lobby
is
filled
with
SMI
agents.
The
blue
Mission
statement
is
in
evidence
everywhere.
Jerry
inconspicuously
turns
the
corner,
yearns
to
blend
in.
It's
impossible,
the
r·ecognition
ripples
through
the
lobby.
Underling
agent
BOB
SUGAR,
25,
is
the
first
to
grab
Maguire
by
the
shoulders.
("Finally,
someone
said
it!")
Suddenly
another
agent
begins
to
clap,
then
reluctantly,
another.
Soon,
the
ovation
rocks
the
lobby.
(In
a
three-shot
near
the
front
desk,
we
see
a
26
year-old
female
employee
of
SMI
applauding
with
Mission
Statement
in
hand,
her
sleepy
son
at
her
side.)
Jerry
motions
for
them
all
to
stop,
but
clearly
he
could
listen
forever.
It
is
a
watershed
moment
in
his
life.

off

He
sits
in

working

airless
and
uncomfortable

of

We
meet
DOROTHY
BOYD,
26.
A
harried
passenger
on
this
bus
in
the
sky.
Her
clothes
are
part-contemporary,
part
mother-functional.
She
is
never
as
composed
or
in
control
as
she
wants
to
be.
Right
now
she
is
devoted
to
the
sneezing
kid
in
the
wrinkled
white-shirt
sitting
next
to
her.
It
i•
RAY,
her
five-year
old
son.
Dorothy
is
covered
in
toys
and
books.
Stuffed
into
the
side
pocket
is
Jerry's
Mission
statement.
The
easy
laughter
from
three
rows
ahead
washes
·over
her
like
cold
water,
as
she
rings
again
for
a
Flight
Attendant.
The
overworked
ATTENDANT
arrives,
pissed,
snapping
off
the
bell.
DOROTHY
.Look,
my
son
is
allergic
to
the
material
in
these
blankets
ATTENDANT
That's
all
we
bave.
The
Attendant
offers
a
bundle
of
soggy
cocktail
napkins
and
is
about
to
exit
as
Ray
makes
a
gagging
noise.
He's
about
to
get
sick.
Both
women
reach
for
an
airsick
bag,
and
get
it
to
his
mouth
just
in
time.
Their
faces
are
now
inches
apart.
ATTENDANT
I'm
sorry
I
was
rude
just
then
DOROTHY
It's
okay.
We're
in
it
together
now

The
Attendant

with
the
bag.
WOMAN'S
VOICE
Don't
take
anything
I
say
seriously!
I
love
to
flirt!
Dorothy,
irritated,
leans
out
into
the
aisle
to
look
for
the
heads
that
belong
to
these
voices.

JERRY
--
so
our
first
date,
she
told
me
about
her
favorite
place
in
the
world,
the
seven
pools
of
Hana
on
the
island

Gorgeous.
JERRY
A
year-and-a-half
later,
we
were
both
in
Hawaii
for
the
Pro
Bowl.
Now.
I've
always.hit
a
wall
at
18
months.
Every
serious
girlfriend
lasts
18
months.
It's
like.
-
ka-boom.
The
curse
of
18
months.
WOMAN
That's
when
you
need
to
c-ent,
and
define
define
define.
JERRY
Exactly.
And
the
world
does
not
need
another
35
year-old
bachelor.
I
knew
I
wanted
to
propose,
so
I
took
her
there.
WOMAN
To
the-pools?
JERRY
To
the
pools.
Now
she's
Miss
Rock
Climber,
and
I'm
more
the
Non-Rock
Climber,
but
we're
hiking
up
through
the
pools
and
there's
a
fine
·
mist
in
the
air,
and
I
have
the
ring
in
my
pocket,
and
I'm
a
little
nervous,
I'm
lagging
behind,
and
she
says
to
•
me,
get
this
.
--
"Hurry
up,
klutz
•
"
WOMAN
Oh
no
JERRY
Well,
it
bothered
me
somewhat.
And
I
got
quiet.
And
now
she's
quiet
and
we're
both
pouting
a
little,
you
know.
And
I
decide·I'm
not
going
to
propose.
The
mood
is
not
right.
~Y
be
impulsive?
Now
at
thia
point
I
know
Jih&
knows
that
I
was
going
to
propose
and
didn't.
And
she
knows
I
know.
So
the
entire
sixty
mile
ride
14
back
to
the
airport,
we
don't
speak.·
And
we're
.bgtb
good
at
that.
We
fly
to
Honolulu
in
silence.
We
check
into
the
Pro
Bowl
hotel

How
sad

But

•••
BACK
TO
OOROTHX
She
is
now
craning
out
into
the
aisle
to
hear
this
story.
The
plane
is
now
quieter.
She
listens
to
the
easy
sound
of
Jerry
discussing
his
charmed
life.

up)
Mama
--
DOROTHY
Shhh.
Mommy's
eavesdropping.
He
sneezes,
three
big
ones
in
a
row.
She
hands
him
more
kleenex,
riveted
on
the
story.
And
listens.
JERRY'S
VOICE
Now
little
do
I
know
that
my
assistant.
has
assumed
that
I've
now
proposed.
so
she
has
gotten
the
lounge
band
to
actually
play
"Here
Comes
The
Bride•
when
we
walk
back
in.
Dorothy
laughs
to
herself,
somewhat
derisively.
She
tries
to
share
the
laugh
with
her
son,
who
stares
at
her.
BACK
TO

LATER
JERRY
Which
they
do.
And
we're
standing
there.
All
the
football
guys
are
in
the
lobby,
watching,
there's
even
an
ESPN
crew
•.
So
I
turn
to
her
and
sort
of
grandly
say,
"Well,
this
is
me,
Klutz,
asking
you,
Goddess
of
Rock
Climbing,
to
marry
me."
And
I
took
out
the
.ring,
and
I
don't
much
like
big
scenes,
but
she
said
"yes"
right
there
in
the
lobby
and
some
of
the
toughest
men
in
football
wept
like
babies.
We're
getting
married
in
February.

the

Jerry
looks
slightly
edgy
at

his

DOROTHY
--
"and

down

a

disappointed.
But
Maguire
bows,
-always
courtly,
and
exits
to
get
his

He
then
realizes
something
amiss

up
again

completing
the

Laurel

Dorothy
returns
to
the

bending
down,
gathering
Ray's
toys.
She
wipes
at
Ray's
hair.
("Don't

She
is
surprised
that
she's
a
little
jazzed
from
her
encounter
with
J'erry
Maguire.
She
can't
help
but
look
back
at
J'erry,
who
catches-
her
looking.
He
salutes
her,
with
mock
circumstance.
She
returns
it
with
a
guilty

He
disappears,
and
she
finds
herself
oddly
short

yanks
away.
Breathing
hard,

just
looks

The
answer

Yugoslavia.
Tepid

many
of

turn
and

furtive
looks
at
Maguire,

stands
at

with
his

sign

signs
something,

a

Dorothy.

kiss

on

Tidwell
leans
across

for

doesn't
offer
one.

chatter.
("Is

"CUsh!

Fans
at

are
calling
out
to

young

("Go

Telegenic
CUsh
shrugs
and
smiles.
("I'll

Jerry
admires
his

There
is
nothing
more
attractive
than
a

burningly
efficient
at

Shot

off

hides
out
in
the

thumbing
through
magazines.
The
chip
on
his
shoulder
grows
by
the
minute.
Elsewhere
in
the
gift
shop,
he
sees
the
very
real
and
emotional
scene
of
a
young
athlete
and
his
mother.
Both
wear
self-promoting
colorful
homemade
t-shirts
with
the
young
athlete's
face
on
it.
Something
about
them,
their
pure
enthusiasm,
rubs
Tidwell
in
an
odd
way.
He
almost
cries,
for.
himself,
for
humanity,
as
Jerry
enters.
Tidwell
is
embarrassed
to
have
been
caught
in
this
misty
state.

With

she
doesn't-quite
understand.
DOROTHY
Too
bad.
JERRY
Better
now
than
later.
We'll
still
be
friends.
I'm
dying
here.
DOROTHY
Jesus,
it's
a
real
g,uh,
isn't
it?
JERRY
And
just
think
if
I
got
her
the
ring
she
really
wanted.
Dorothy
laughs.
He
looks
at
her
strangely.
Suddenly
she
feels
very
nervous,
as
he
sets
down
his
bags.
DOROTHY
sorry.
Uh,
let
me
see,
have
a
seat.
I'll
get
you
some
aloe
vera
for
that
cut
too.
JERRY
Do
you
have
something
to
drink?
DOROTHY
sure
--
She
moves
to
the
kitehen
door.
She
is
about
to
·exit,
when
Jerry
begins
to
unburden.

JERRY
My
brother
works
for
the
White
House.
He
pretends
he's
an
intellectual.
He
pretends
he's
from
the
east
coast.
She
turns,
not
quite
sure
what
his
point
is.
She
waits
politely
for
Jerry
to
finish
before
exiting
into
the
kitchen.
JERRY
X
was
supposed
to
be
the
successful
one;
But
I
don't
want
to
talk
about
it.
And
yet!
My
family.
I
grew
up
with
repression
as
a
...
a
religion
-
you
don't
bitch.
No
moaning!
Head
down.
Do
it,
whatever
"it"
may
be.
My
dad

worked
for

for
38
years!
You
know
what
he
said

He
said,
"I
wish
I'd
had
a
more
comfortable
chair.•
38
years
he
sat
in
it!
Do
you
know
what
I'm
saying,
Dorothy?
Repression
as
a
religion.
I'm
almost
as
old
as
his
chair.
He
rubs
his
face.
She
looks
at
him,
and
the
situation
slightly
overwhems
here.·
Here
he
is,
wide-open,
ripe

Dorothy
goes
for
the
refrigerator,
finds
a
couple
beers.
LAUREL
I
heard.
DOROTHY
No
kidding.
I
looked
over
and
saw
the
shadow
of
two
curious
shoes
in
the
doorway
of
the
kitchen.
LAUREL
This
guy
would
go
home
with
a
gardening
tool
right
now
if
it
showed
interest.
(cff
Dorothy's
look)
Wait.

DOROTHY
(surprised)·
Thank
you.
LAUREL
Look,
here's
some
of
that
chicken
with
salsa
too,
I
warmed
it
up
DOROTHY
That's
the
girl
I
love.
LAUREL
But
you
just
gotta
hear
me
out
on
one
thing.
You're
very
responsible
with
Ray
and
you
know
it's
not
right
for
a
little
boy
to
hear
some
strange
man's
voice
in
the
house.
DOROTHY
As
opposed
to
twenty
angry
women?
Dorothy
turns
quickly
and
the
beer,
sisters
and
chicken
collide
in
the
small
kitchen.
Dorothy
deftly
catches
the
food
in
her
t-shirt,
and
dWllps
it
back
onto
the
plate.
But
her
shirt
is
now
stained.
She
starts
to
quietly
implode,
and
Laurel
takes
command.
They
know

All
I'm

You
don't
have
the
luxury
of
falling
for
some
drowning
man.
Be
practical.
Now.
Which
top?
She
holds
up
two
tops.
One
is
sexier
with
a
dipped
down

The.other
is
striped,
cute,
functional.
DOROTHY
Okay,
you
want
to
talk
about
practical?
Let's
talk
about
my
.wonderful
life.
Do
you
know
what
most
other
women

doing
right

They
are
partying

She
grabs

puts
it
on.
DOROTHY
I've
got
a
24

a
day
reminder
of
Roger,
for
the
rest
of
my

I
have
had
three
lovers
in
four
years,
all
boring,
all
achingly
self-sufficient,
all
friends

yours
I
might
add,
and
all
of
them
running

Look

I'm

Do

RAY
Let's
go

JERRY
Okay.
I've
been
hogging
it.
You're
right.
All
my

I've
been
trying
to
talk,
really
talk,
and
no
one
wants
to
listen.
You
know

Ray
nods
vigorously.
RAY
Let's
go

We'll
go

sits
contemplating

for
a

swings
open

a
harried
Dorothy
appears
in

sexier
top,

with
a
distinctly
less
sexy
attitude,
and
a
tray.
DOROTHY
Drinks.

I
called
you

JERRY

confused)
Good

DOROTHY
And
we
should
keep

voices
down

I
have
a

asleep.
JERRY
Right.
Of
course.
Jerry
tries
to
twist
open
the
beer,
ripping
at
his
palm.
It's
not
a
twist-off.
She
hands
him
an

He
opens
it,
inelegantly.
DOROTHY

coughs
a

stands.

reaches
for

begins
to
joust
with
an
imaginary
opponent.

He
collapses
onto
the
sofa,
embarrassed.
Shaking
his
head.
Dorothy
scoots
closer
in
an
adjacent
chair.
She
breaks
the
personal
barrier,
carefully
touching
his
wound
with
the
wet
tip
of
the
aloe
vera

Truth?
JERRY
Sure.

Of

But
mostly

(very
honest)

is
something
inspiring
about

says

"inspiring."
JERRY

DOROTHY
What
you
wrote

I,
for

Laurel?
Maybe
I
am
taking

Am
I
a
bad
person?
All
I
know
is
that
I

someone
who
was
charming

popular

not-so-nice
to
me

and
he
died.
Okay?
So
why
should
I
let
this

go,

everything

you're
interested

I
was
just
about

down

an
odd
feeling.
A
shivver
runs
up

down
his

His

tingles.
He
rubs
his

All

DOROTHY
I've
listened
to
you
all
tell
a
thousand
sob
stories,
and
I
have
been
very
judgmental.
Frankly,
I
think
you've
all
been
waaaay
too
comfortable
with
your
pain.
Plus,
Jan,
you
always
spill
your
red
wine
on
the
couch.
(off
Jan's
guilty
look)
I've
not
been
fair
to
you.
Women
need
to
stick
together,
and
not
depend
on
the
affections
of
a
man
to
"fix•
their
lives.
Maybe
you're
all
correct.
Men
are
the
enemy.
Murmurs
of
agreement.
DOROTHY
But
I
still
love
the
enemy.
Murmurs
