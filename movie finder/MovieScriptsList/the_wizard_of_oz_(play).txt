For
nearly
forty
years
this
story
has
given
faithful
service
to
the
Young
in
Heart;
and
Time
has
been
powerless
to
put
its
kindly
philosophy
out
of
fashion.
To
those
of
you
who
have
been
faithful
to
it
in
return...and
to
the
Young
in
Heart
---
we
dedicate
this
picture.

DOROTHY
Zeke,
what
am
I
going
to
do
about
Miss

Just

Listen,

HUNK
Now
lookit,
Dorothy,
you
ain't
using
your
head
about
Miss
Gulch.
Think
you
didn't
have
any
brains
at
all.

DOROTHY
I
have
so
got
brains.
HUNK
Well,
why
don't
you
use
them?
When
you
come
home,
don't
go
by
Miss
Gulch's
place.
Then
Toto
won't
get
in
her
garden,
and
you
won't
get
in
no
trouble.
See?
DOROTHY
Oh,
Hunk,
you
just
won't
listen,
that's
all.

Well,
your
head
ain't
made

Oh!
Oh,
it

like
my
joints
are
rusted.
Listen,
Dorothy,
don't
let
Hunk
kid
you
about
Miss
Gulch.
She's
just
a
poor
sour-faced
old
maid
that
--
she
ain't
got
no
heart
left.
You
know,
you
should
have
a
little
more
heart
yourself,
and
have
pity
on
her.
DOROTHY
Well,
gee,
I
try
and
have
a
heart.
HICKORY
Now
look,
here's
something
that
really
has
a
heart.
This
is
the
best
invention
I
ever
invented.
DOROTHY
This?
HICKORY
Sure.
It's
to
break
up
winds,
so
we
don't
have
no
more
dust
storms.
Can
you
imagine
what
it'll
mean
to
this
section
of
the
country?
I'll
show
you.
It
works
perfectly
now.
Here's
the
principle.
You
see
that
fan
--
that
sends
up
air
currents
into
the
sky.
These
air
currents
--
Oh,
stop
it!
DOROTHY
Oh!
HICKORY
Who
did
it?
Now
wait
a
minute.
DOROTHY
Hickory!
HICKORY
Now
what
happened?
I'll
bet
Hunk
did
that.

you!
Listen,

are
you
going
to
let
that
old
Gulch
heifer
try
and
buffalo

She
ain't

afraid
of.
Have

Why,

What's

Now,

All
right,

But
some
day
they're
going
to
erect
a
statue
to
me

Well,
don't

it
now.
Here,

empty
stomach.
Have
some
crullers.

Gosh,

Just

Thanks.

It's

go

hogs

themselves

Yes'am.

Now,
Dorothy,

stop
imagining
things.
You

get
yourself
into
a
fret
over
nothing.
DOROTHY
No
–
AUNT
EM
Now,
you
just
help
us
out
today,
and
find
yourself
a
place
where
you
won't
get
into
any
trouble.

place
where
there
isn't
any
trouble.

Do
you
suppose
there
is
such
a
place,
Toto?
There
must
be.
It's
not
a
place
you
can
get
to
by
a
boat
or
a
train.
It's
far,
far
away

behind

beyond

rain

DOROTHY
(sings)
Somewhere,
over
the
rainbow,
way
up
high,
There's
a
land
that
I
heard
of
once
in
a
lullaby.
Somewhere,
over
the
rainbow,
skies
are
blue,
And
the
dreams
that
you
dare
to
dream
really
do...come
true…Someday
I'll
wish
upon
a
star
And
wake
up
where
the
clouds
are
far
behind
me.
Where
troubles
melt
like
lemon
drops,
Away
above
the
chimney
tops,
That's
where
you'll
find
me.
Somewhere,
over
the
rainbow,
bluebirds
fly.
Birds
fly
over
the
rainbow,
Why
then
--
oh,
why
can't
I?
If
happy
little
bluebirds
fly
Beyond
the
rainbow
Why,
oh,
why
can't
I?

Please,

He

I'm
the

that
ought
to

How

it

if

him
tied

He's

with

MISS

Well,
that's
for
the

Here's

to
take
him.
Unless

DOROTHY
No

Here's
what
I'm
taking
him
in

DOROTHY
Oh,

I
won't
let

Glinda,
the
Good
Which
floats
down
in
her
bubble
and
lands
happily
in
front
of
Dorothy.
DOROTHY
Now
I
--
I
know
we're
not
in
Kansas.
GLINDA
Are
you
a
good
witch,
or
a
bad
witch?
DOROTHY
Who,
me?
Why,
I'm
not
a
witch
at
all.
I'm
Dorothy
Gale
from
Kansas.
GLINDA
Oh!
Well...is
that
the
Witch?
DOROTHY
Who,
Toto?
Toto's
my
dog.
GLINDA
Well,
I'm
a
little
muddled.
The
Munchkins
called
me
because
a
new
witch
has
just
dropped
a
house
on
the
Wicked
Witch
of
the
East.
And
there's
the
house,
and
here
you
are,
and
that's
all...

The
Wicked
Witch

–
GLINDA
...that's
left
of
the
Wicked
Witch
of
the
East.
And
so
what
the
Munchkins
want
to
know...is,
are
you
a
good
witch,
or
a
bad
witch?
DOROTHY
Oh,
but
I've
already
told
you,
I'm
not
a
witch
at
all
--
witches
are
old
and
ugly.
Narrator

There
is
unseen
laughter
all
around
Dorothy.
DOROTHY
What
was
that?
GLINDA
The
Munchkins.
They're
laughing
because
I
am
a
witch.
I'm
Glinda,
the
Witch
of
the
North.
DOROTHY
You
are!
Oh,
I
beg
your
pardon!
But
I've
never
heard
of
a
beautiful....witch
before.
GLINDA
Only
bad
witches
are
ugly.

The

are
happy
because
you
have
freed
them
from
the
Wicked
Witch
of
the
East.
DOROTHY
Oh.
But,
if
you
please
--
what
are
Munchkins?
GLINDA
The
little
people
who
live
in
this
land
--
it's
Munchkinland,
and
you
are
their
national
heroine,
my
dear.
It's
all
right
--
you
may
all
come
out
and
thank
her.
It's
all
right
now
-
you
may
all
come
out.
GLINDA
(sings)
Come
out,
come
out,
wherever
you
are
And
meet
the
young
lady
who
fell
from
a
star.
She
fell
from
the
sky,
she
fell
very
far.
And
Kansas
she
says
is
the
name
of
the
star.
MUNCHKINS
(sing)
Kansas
she
says
is
the
name
of
the
star.
GLINDA
(sings)
She
brings
you
good
news.
Or
haven't
you
heard?
When
she
fell
out
of
Kansas,
a
miracle
occurred.
DOROTHY
(sings)
It
really
was
no
miracle.
What
happened
was
just
this:
The
wind
began
to
switch
--
the
house
to
pitch
And
suddenly
the
hinges
started
to
unhitch.
Just
then,
the
witch
--
to
satisfy
an
itch
--
Went
flying
on
her
broomstick
thumbing
for...a
hitch.
MUNCHKINS
(sing)
And
oh,
what
happened
then
was
rich!
The
house
began
to
pitch
The
kitchen
took
a
slitch
It
landed
on
the
Wicked
Witch
In
the
middle
of
a
ditch
Which
was
not
a
healthy
situation
For
the
Wicked
Witch.

which

the

back

I
can't

the
way
I
came.
GLINDA
No
--
that's

who
might

would
be

good,

very
mysterious.
He
lives
in
the
Emerald
City,
and
that's
a
long
journey
from
here.
Did
you
bring
your
broomstick
with
you?
DOROTHY
No,
I'm
afraid
I
didn't.
GLINDA
Well,
then,
you'll
have
to
walk.
The
Munchkins
will
see
you
safely
to
the
border
of
Munchkinland.
And
remember,
never
let
those
ruby
slippers
off
your
feet
for
a
moment,
or
you
will
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
Wicked
Witch
of
the
West.

DOROTHY
But,
how
do
I
start
for
Emerald
City?
GLINDA
It's

to
start
at
the
beginning

all
you
do
is

a
Scarecrow
on
a

in

at

to

SCARECROW
It's
pleasant
down
that
way,
too.
DOROTHY
...don't
talk.
That's
funny.
Wasn't
he
pointing
the
other
way?
SCARECROW
Of
course,
people
do....

Scarecrow
crosses
his

points

both

SCARECROW
...go
both

DOROTHY
Why...you
did
say
something,
didn't
you?
Narrator
07
The
Scarecrow
shakes
his
head,
then
nods
–
DOROTHY
Are
you
doing
that
on
purpose,
or
can't
you
make
up
your
mind?
SCARECROW
That's
the
trouble.
I
can't
make
up
my
mind.
I
haven't
got
a
brain
--
only
straw.
DOROTHY
How
can
you
talk
if
you
haven't
got
a
brain?
SCARECROW
I
don't
know.
But
some
people
without
brains
do
an
awful
lot
of
talking,
don't
they?
DOROTHY
Yes,
I
guess
you're
right.
Well,
we
haven't
really
met
properly,
have
we?
SCARECROW
Why,
no.
DOROTHY
How
do
you
do?
21
SCARECROW
How
do
you
do?
DOROTHY
Very
well,
thank
you.
SCARECROW
Oh,
I'm
not
feeling
at
all
well.
You
see,
it's
very
tedious
being
stuck
up
here
all
day
long
with
a
pole
up
your
back.
DOROTHY
Oh,
dear
--
that
must
be
terribly
uncomfortable.
Can't
you
get
down?
SCARECROW
Down?
No,
you
see,
I'm
--
Well,
--
I'm
–
DOROTHY
Oh,
well,
here
--
let
me
help
you.
SCARECROW
Oh,
that's
very
kind
of
you
--
very
kind.
DOROTHY
Well,
oh,
dear
--
I
don't
quite
see....
how
I
can
–
SCARECROW
Of
course,
I'm
not
bright
about
doing
things,
but
if
you'll
just....bend
the
nail
down
in
the
back,
maybe
I'll
slip
off
and...
DOROTHY
Oh....
Narrator

Dorothy
turns
the
nail
and
the
Scarecrow
falls
to
the
ground
–
DOROTHY
...yes.
SCARECROW
Whhhooops!
Ha-ha
--
there
goes
some
of
me
again!
DOROTHY
Oh
--
does
it
hurt
you?
SCARECROW
Oh,
no
--
I
just
keep
picking
it
up
and
putting
it
back
in
again.
DOROTHY
Ohhh
–
SCARECROW
My,
it's
good
to
be....

Dorothy
screams
as
the
Scarecrow
whirls
about
and
falls
over
the
cornfield
fence

she
rushes
to
him

him

speak
–
SCARECROW
...free!
DOROTHY
Oh!
Oh!
Ohhh!
SCARECROW
Did
I
scare
you?
DOROTHY
No,
No
--
I
--
I
just
thought
you
hurt
yourself.
SCARECROW
But
I
didn't
scare
you?
DOROTHY
No
--
of
course
not.
SCARECROW
I
didn't
think
so.
Boo!
You
see,
I
can't
even
scare
a
crow!
They
come
from
miles
around
just
to
eat
in
my
field
and
laugh
in
my
face!
Oh,
I'm
a
failure,
because
I
haven't
got
a
brain.
22
DOROTHY
Well,
what
would
you
do
with
a
brain
if
you
had
one?
SCARECROW
Do?
Why,
if
I
had
a
brain,
I
could
--
(sings)
I
could
while
away
the
hours,
Conferrin'
with
the
flowers,
Consultin'
with
the
rain.
And
my
head
I'd
be
scratchin'
While
my
thoughts
were
busy
hatchin'
If
I
only
had
a
brain.
I'd
unravel
every
riddle
For
any
individ'le
In
trouble
or
in
pain.
DOROTHY
(sings)
With
the
thoughts
you'll
be
thinkin'
You
could
be
another
Lincoln
If
you
only
had
a
brain.
SCARECROW
(sings)
Oh,
I
could
tell
you
why
The
ocean's
near
the
shore
I
could
think
of
things
I
never
thunk
before,
And
then
I'd
sit
--
and
think
some
more.
I
would
not
be
just
a
nuffin'
My
head
all
full
of
stuffin'
My
heart
all
full
of
pain.
I
would
dance
and
be
merry...Life
would
be
a
ding-a-derry
If
I
only
had
a
brain!
Gosh,
it
would
be
awful
pleasin'
To
reason
out
the
reason
For
things
I
can't
explain.
Then
perhaps
I'll
deserve
you,
And
be
even
worthy
erv
you
If
I
only
had
a
brain.
DOROTHY
Wonderful!
Why,
if
our
Scarecrow
back
in
Kansas
could
do
that,
the
crows'd
be
scared
to
pieces!
SCARECROW
They
would?
DOROTHY
Um-hmm.
SCARECROW
Where's
Kansas?
DOROTHY
That's
where
I
live.
And
I
want
to
get
back
there
so
badly
I'm
going
all
the
way
to
Emerald
City
to
get
the
Wizard
of
Oz
to
help
me.
SCARECROW
You're
going
to
see
a
Wizard?
DOROTHY
Um-hmm.
SCARECROW
Do
you
think
if
I
went
with
you
this
Wizard
would
give
me
some
brains?
DOROTHY
I
couldn't
say.
But
even
if
he
didn't,
you'd
be
no
worse
off
than
you
are
now.
SCARECROW
Yes
--
that's
true.
DOROTHY
But
maybe
you'd
better
not.
I've
got
a
witch
mad
at
me,
and
you
might
get
into
trouble.
SCARECROW
Witch?
Huh!
I'm
not
afraid
of
a
witch!
I'm
not
afraid
of
anything
---
except
a
lighted
match.
DOROTHY
I
don't
blame
you
for
that.
SCARECROW
But
I'd
face
a
whole
box
full
of
them
for
the
chance
of
getting
some
brains.
Look
--
I
won't
be
any
trouble,
because
I
don't
eat
a
thing
--
and
I
won't
try
to
manage
things,
because
I
can't
think.
Won't
you
take
me
with
you?
DOROTHY
Why,
of
course
I
will!
SCARECROW
Hooray!
We're

to
see
a

Well,

I'm
torn

because
I'm
presumin'
That
I
could
be
kind-a
human,
If
I
only
had
a
heart.
I'd
be
tender

I'd
be
gentle
And
awful
sentimental
Regarding

I'd
be

And
the

who

If

had
a

me....a

a
voice
sings
low.
Wherefore
art
thou,

I
hear
a
beat....how
sweet!
Just
to
register
emotion
Jealousy
--
Devotion
--
And
really
feel
the
part,
I
could
stay
young

And

a
zipper,
If
I
only
had
a
heart...!

As
a

just
an
old

it

have
died

It's

you'll
get
into
trouble.

couldn't
have,

do
that
for?
I
didn't
bite
him.
DOROTHY
No,
but
you
tried
to.
It's
bad
enough

on
poor

you
didn't
have
to
go

Well,
of

not.
My

what
a

you're
making.
Well,

right

I
am
a
coward.
I
haven't
any
courage
at
all.
I
even
scare
myself.

at
the
circles
under
my

I
haven't
slept
in

bad.

could
help
him,
too?

I
don't
see
why
not.
Why

I'm

could
give
you
some
courage.

Well,
wouldn't
you
feel
degraded
to
be

I
would.

No,

A-hah!

So!
You
won't
take
warning,
eh?
All
the
worse
for
you,

I'll
take
care
of
you
now
instead
of
later!

those

slippers,

be
the
greatest
in
Oz!
And

my

Something
with
poison
in
it,
I
think.
With
32
poison
in
it,
but
attractive
to
the
eye

and
soothing
to
the
smell!

you
to
a

you
can
tidy
up
a
bit.

Oh,

We've

never
seen
a
horse
like
that
before!

No

and
never
will

There's
only
one

him,

he's
it.
He's
the

Different
Color,

The

to
walk
down
a
very
long,
dark

There
are
no

Oh,

DOROTHY
Don't

Wizard's
going
to
give
you
some
courage?
LION
I'd
be
too
scared
to
ask
him
for
it.
DOROTHY
Oh,
well,
then
--
we'll
ask
him
for
you.
LION
I'd
sooner
wait
outside.
DOROTHY
But

Why?

Because
I'm

Oh,

Bring

SCARECROW
You
humbug!
LION
Yeah!
WIZARD
Yes-s-s
--
that...that's
exactly
so.
I'm
a
humbug!
DOROTHY
Oh,
you're
a
very
bad
man!
WIZARD
Oh,
no,
my
dear
--
I'm
--
I'm
a
very
good
man.
I'm
just
a
very
bad
Wizard.
SCARECROW
You'd
better
be
good
enough
to
send
Dorothy
back
to
Kansas!
WIZARD
Uh
-
now,
please
don't
be
angry
with
me.
I'll
-
I'll
do
anything
you
say,
only...
only
if
you
don't
shout
at
me.
It
makes
me
nervous!
SCARECROW
It
makes
you
nervous?
WIZARD
Yes.
SCARECROW
What
about
us?
WIZARD
Well,
I
–
SCARECROW
What
about
the
heart
that
you
promised
Tin
Man
--?
WIZARD
Well,
I
–
SCARECROW
And
the
courage
that
you
promised
Cowardly
Lion?
WIZARD
Well,
I
–
TIN
MAN
&
LION
And
Scarecrow's
brain?
WIZARD
Well,
I--
but
you've
got
them.
You've
had
them
all
the
…
time!
ALL
TOGETHER
Oh,
no
we
haven't!
TIN
MAN
You
don't
get
around
us
that
easy!
LION
Not
nohow!
WIZARD
Well
–
SCARECROW
You
promised
us
real
things
--
a
real
brain!
TIN
MAN
A
real
heart!
53
LION
Real
courage.
That's
what
we
want.
WIZARD
You
do?
boys,
you're
aiming
low.
You
not
only
surprise,
but
you
grieve
me.
Why,
anybody
can
have
a
brain.
That's
a
very
mediocre
commodity.
Every
spineless
creature
that
crawls
on
the
earth
–
or
slinks
through
slimy
seas
has
a
brain!
From
the
rock-bound
coast
of
Maine
to
the
Sun....
oh
-
oh,
no
--
--
ah
-
Well,
be
that
as
it
may.
Back
where
I
come
from
we
have
universities,
seats
of
great
learning
--
where
men
go
to
become
great
thinkers.
And
when
they
come
out,
they
think
deep
thoughts
--
and
with
no
more
brains
than
you
have....
But!
They
have
one
thing
you
haven't
got!
A
diploma!
Therefore,
by
virtue
of
the
authority
vested
in
me
by
the
Universitatus
Committeeatum
e
plurbis
unum,
I
hereby
confer
upon
you
the
honorary
degree
of
Th.D.
SCARECROW
Th.D.?
WIZARD
Yeah
--
that...that's
Dr.
of
Thinkology!
SCARECROW
The
sum
of
the
square
roots
of
any
two
sides
of
an
isosceles
triangle
is
equal
to
the
square
root
of
the
remaining
side.
Oh
joy,
rapture!
I've
got
a
brain!
How
can
I
ever
thank
you
enough?
WIZARD
Well,
you
can't.
As
for
you,
my
fine
friend
--
you're
a
victim
of
disorganized
thinking.
You
are
under
the
unfortunate
delusion
that
simply
because
you
run
away
from
danger,
you
have
no
courage.
You're
confusing
courage
with
wisdom.
Back
where
I
come
from,
we
have
men
who
are
called
heroes.
Once
a
year,
they
take
their
fortitude
out
of
mothballs
and
parade
it
down
the
main
street
of
the
city.
And
they
have
no
more
courage
than
you
have.
But!
They
have
one
thing
that
you
haven't
got!
A
medal!
Therefore
--
for
meritorious
conduct,
extraordinary
valor,
conspicuous
bravery
against
wicked
witches,
I
award
you
the
Triple
Cross.
You
are
now
a
member
of
the
Legion
of
Courage!
LION
Oh
--
Oh
--
shucks,
folks,
I'm
speechless!
WIZARD
As
for
you,
my
galvanized
friend,
you
want
a
heart!
You
don't
know
how
lucky
you
are
not
to
have
one.
Hearts
will
never
be
practical
until
they
can
be
made
unbreakable.
I
could
have
been
a
world
figure,
a
power
among
men,
a
-
a
successful
wizard,
had
I
not
been
obstructed
by
a
heart.
TIN
MAN
But
I
still
want
one.
WIZARD
Yes,
back
where
I
come
from
there
are
men
who
do
nothing
all
day
but
good
deeds.
They
are
called
phil...er
--
er
--
phil
--
er,
yes...good-deed-doers.
And
their
hearts
are
no
bigger
than
yours.
But!
They
have
one
thing
you
haven't
got!
A
testimonial!
Therefore,
in
consideration
of
your
kindness,
I
take
pleasure
at
this
time
in
presenting
you
with
a
small
token
of
our
esteem
and
affection.
And
remember,
my
sentimental
friend
that
a
heart
is
not
judged
by
how
much
you
love,
but
by
how
much
you
are
loved
by
others.
TIN

Ahh

Oh,
it
ticks!
Listen!
DOROTHY
Yes...!

Look

Read...read
what
my

says…Courage!..Ain't
it
the

Ain't

the

DOROTHY
Oh
--
oh
--
they're
all
wonderful.
SCARECROW
Hey
--
what
about
Dorothy?
TIN
MAN
Yes
--
how
about
Dorothy?
LION
Yeah.
WIZARD
Ah
–
LION
Dorothy
next!
WIZARD
Yes.
Dorothy
--
ah
--
Dor
–
DOROTHY
Oh,
I
don't
think
there's
anything
in
that
black
bag
for
me.
WIZARD
Well,
no
-
no
--
on
the
contrary,
on
the
----
I
--
ah
--
on
the
contr
--
--
Here
--
Well,
you
force
me
into
a
cataclysmic
decision.
The
only
way
to
get
Dorothy
back
to
Kansas
is
for
me
to
take
her
there
myself!
DOROTHY
Oh,
will
you?
Could
you?
Oh
--
but
are
you
a
clever
enough
Wizard
to
manage
it?
WIZARD
Child
--
you
cut
me
to
the
quick!
I'm
an
old
Kansas
man
myself...born
and....bred
in
the
heart
of
the
western
wilderness
--
Premier
balloonist
par....excellence
to
the
Miracle
Wonderland
Carnival
Company
--
until
one
day,
while
performing
spectacular
feats
of
stratospheric
skill
never
before
attempted
by
civilized
man,
an
unfortunate
phenomena
occurred.
The
balloon
failed
to
return
to
the
fair.
LION
It
did?
WIZARD
Yes.
There
was
I,
floating
through
space
--
a
man
without
a
continent!
DOROTHY
Weren't
you
frightened?
WIZARD
Frightened?
You
are
talking
to
a
man
who
has
laughed
in
the
face
of
death
–
sneered
at
doom
and
chuckled
at
catastrophe.
I
was
petrified.
Then
suddenly
the
wind
changed,
and
the
balloon
floated
down
into
the
heart
of
this
noble
city,
where
I
was
instantly
acclaimed
Oz,
the
First
Wizard
de
Luxe!
DOROTHY
Ohhh!
WIZARD
Times
being
what
they
were,
I
accepted
the
job,
--
retaining
my
balloon
against
the
advent
of
a
quick
get-away.
(laughs)
And
in
that
balloon,
my
dear
Dorothy,
you
and
I
will
return
to
the
land
of
E
Pluribus
Unum!

Good
people

this
is
positively
the
finest
exhibition
ever
to
be
shown

I,
your

am
about
to
embark
upon
a
hazardous
and
technically
unexplainable
journey
into
the
outer
stratosphere.
To
confer,
converse,
and
otherwise
hob-nob
with

And
I
hereby
decree

if
any

that
I
return,
the
Scarecrow,
by
virtue

Obey

me!
And

ah

well,
that's
all.
Thank
you.

I'll

Stay
with

then,
Dorothy.
We
all
love
you.
We
don't
want
you
to
go.
DOROTHY
Oh,
that's
very
kind
of
you
--
but
this
could
never
be
like
Kansas.
Auntie
Em
must
have
stopped
wondering
what
happened
to
me
by
now.
Oh,
Scarecrow,
what
am
I
going
to
do?
SCARECROW
Look
--
here's
someone
who
can
help
you!
Narrator

Suddenly
Glinda
appears
--
heads
of
the
people
of
OZ
bow
as
she
moves
down
the
steps
and
up
onto
the
platform
to
Dorothy,
Tin
Man,
Lion
and
Scarecrow
–
DOROTHY
Oh,
will
you
help
me?
Can
you
help
me?
GLINDA
You
don't
need
to
be
helped
any
longer.
You've
always
had
the
power
to
go
back
to
Kansas.
DOROTHY
I
have?
SCARECROW
Then
why
didn't
you
tell
her
before?
GLINDA
Because
she
wouldn't
have
believed
me.
She
had
to
learn
it
for
herself.
TIN
MAN
What
have
you
learned,
Dorothy?
DOROTHY
Well,
I
--
I
think
that
it
--
that
it
wasn't
enough
just
to
want
to
see
Uncle
Henry
and
Auntie
Em
--
and
it's
that
–
if
I
ever
go
looking
for
my
heart's
desire
again,
I
won't
look
any
further
than
my
own
backyard.
Because
if
it
isn't
there,
I
never
really
lost
it
to
begin
with!
Is
that
right?
GLINDA
That's
all
it
is!
SCARECROW
But
that's
so
easy!
I
should
have
thought
of
it
for
you.
TIN
MAN
I
should
have
felt
it
in
my
heart.
GLINDA
No.
She
had
to
find
it
out
for
herself.
Now,
those
magic
slippers
will
take
you
home
in
two
seconds!
DOROTHY
Oh....
Toto,
too?
GLINDA
Toto,
too.
DOROTHY
Oh,
now?
GLINDA
Whenever
you
wish.
57
DOROTHY
Oh,
dear
--
that's
too
wonderful
to
be
true!
Oh,
it's
--
it's
going
to
be
so
hard
to
say
goodbye.
I
love
you
all,
too.
Goodbye,
Tin
Man.
Oh,
don't
cry.
You'll
rust
so
dreadfully.
Here
--
here's
your
oil-can.
Goodbye.
TIN
MAN
Now
I
know
I've
got
a
heart
--
'cause
it's
breaking.
DOROTHY
Oh
--
Goodbye,
Lion.
You
know,
I
know
it
isn't
right,
but
I'm
going
to
miss
the
way
you
used
to
holler
for
help
before
you
found
your
courage.
LION
Well
--
I
would
never've
found
it
if
it
hadn't
been
for
you.
DOROTHY
I
think
I'll
miss
you
most
of
all.
GLINDA
Are
you
ready
now?
DOROTHY
Yes.
Say
goodbye,
Toto.
I’m
ready
now.
GLINDA
Then
close
your
eyes,
and
tap
your
heels
together
three
times
and
think
to
yourself
--
"There's
no
place
like
home;
there's
no
place
like
home;
there's
no
place
like
home."
DOROTHY
There's
no
place
like
home.
There's
no
place
like
home.
There's
no
place
like
home.
There's
no
place
like
home.

honey.
DOROTHY
…no
place
like
home
--
there's
no
place
like
home
--
no
place
–
AUNT
EM
Dorothy.
Dorothy,
dear.
It's
Aunt
Em,
darling.
DOROTHY
Oh,
Auntie
Em
--
it's
you!
AUNT
EM
Yes,
darling.
PROFESSOR
MARVEL
Hello,
there!
Anybody
home?
I
--
I
just
dropped
by
because
I
heard
the
little
girl
got
caught
in
the
big
–
Well,
she
seems
all
right
now.
UNCLE
HENRY
Yeah.
She
got
quite
a
bump
on
the
head
--
we
kinda
thought
there
for
a
minute
she
was
going
to
leave
us.
PROFESSOR
Oh
–

DOROTHY
But
I
did
leave
you,
Uncle
Henry
--
that's
just
the
trouble.
And
I
tried
to
get
back
for
days
and
days.
AUNT
EM
There,
there,
lie
quiet
now.
You
just
had
a
bad
dream.
DOROTHY
Oh,
No
–
HUNK
Sure
--
remember
me
--
your
old
pal,
Hunk?
HICKORY
And
me
--
Hickory?
ZEKE
You
couldn't
forget
my
face,
could
you?
DOROTHY
No.
But
it
wasn't
a
dream
--
it
was
a
place.
And
you
--
and
you
--
and
you
--
and
you
were
there.
PROFESSOR
Oh
--
(others
laugh)
DOROTHY
But
you
couldn't
have
been,
could
you?
AUNT
EM
Oh,
we
dream
lots
of
silly
things
when
we
–
DOROTHY
No,
Aunt
Em
--
this
was
a
real,
truly
live
place.
And
I
remember
that
some
of
it
wasn't
very
nice
but
most
of
it
was
beautiful.
But
just
the
same,
all
I
kept
saying
to
everybody
was,
I
want
to
go
home.
And
they
sent
me
home.
Oh,
Doesn't
anybody
believe
me?
UNCLE
HENRY
Of
course
we
believe
you,
Dorothy.
DOROTHY
Oh,
but
anyway,
Toto,
we're
home!
Home!
And
this
is
my
room
--
and
you're
all
here!
And
I'm
not
going
to
leave
here
ever,
ever
again,
because
I
love
you
all!
And
--
Oh,
Auntie
Em
--
there's
no
place
like
home!
